**Praxis** is an ongoing project that focuses on building a new city-state based on decentralized governance and shared philosophical principles. The goal is to create a community governed by blockchain technology, where residents have control over decision-making. While the project is still developing, it represents a strong effort toward creating a physical community with digital, decentralized governance.
