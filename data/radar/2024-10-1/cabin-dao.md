**CabinDAO** is a decentralized network of off-grid cabins and rural communities where members can live and collaborate remotely. Itâ€™s an active experiment in decentralized co-living, where governance and decision-making are handled by a DAO. The project focuses on creating digital nomad-friendly spaces that are connected through decentralized governance structures.
