**Zuzalu** is a pop-up city community designed to facilitate collaboration around key themes such as health, longevity, and decentralization. It operates as an experimental, temporary autonomous zone where residents participate in governance and decision-making around these specific interests. The thematic focus on health and technological innovation makes Zuzalu a prime example of a thematic, decentralized network.
