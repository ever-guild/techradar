**Kift DAO** is a decentralized community of vanlifers and digital nomads that combines physical co-living spaces with decentralized governance. Members travel between various co-living hubs, sharing resources and decision-making responsibilities through a DAO. The project aims to create a network of sustainable co-living spaces where individuals can live and work remotely.
