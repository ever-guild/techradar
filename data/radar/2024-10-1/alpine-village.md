**Alpine Village** is a decentralized co-living community within CabinDAO, aimed at creating off-grid, sustainable living environments. The thematic focus here is on digital nomadism and nature-focused lifestyles, offering members a way to live remotely while being part of a networked community. Governance is handled through a DAO, making it both a decentralized and thematic network.
