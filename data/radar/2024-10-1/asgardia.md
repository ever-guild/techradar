**Asgardia** is a space-based micronation founded in 2016 with the goal of establishing a human colony in space. It operates as a digital nation, offering virtual citizenship and a constitution while planning future space missions. Asgardiaâ€™s aim is to create a new form of governance in space, separate from Earth-bound nation-states, with a focus on science, space exploration, and peace.
