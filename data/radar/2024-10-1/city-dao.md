**CityDAO** is an ongoing project that aims to build a decentralized city with governance rooted in blockchain technology. The community is organized through a DAO, allowing people to collectively own and manage land. Their first piece of land is in Wyoming, USA, and the goal is to experiment with decentralized governance over physical real estate.
