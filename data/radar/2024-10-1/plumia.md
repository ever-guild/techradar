**Plumia** is a virtual state initiative under SafetyWing, designed to cater to global citizens, particularly digital nomads and remote workers. Plumiaâ€™s vision is to offer digital governance services, such as virtual citizenship, and to create a decentralized, borderless digital nation with key services like healthcare, insurance, and legal support for its members.
