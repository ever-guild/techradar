Liberland is one of the most well-known modern micronations, founded in 2015 on a small piece of land between Croatia and Serbia. It promotes libertarian values such as minimal government interference and individual freedoms. While the physical land remains disputed, Liberland has established a strong virtual presence, with citizenship, taxes, and governance managed digitally through blockchain.
