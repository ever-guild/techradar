**Sealand** is a long-standing micronation located on a former sea fort off the coast of the UK. Founded in 1967, Sealand claims to be the smallest country in the world. While it is a physical entity, its influence and governance have largely shifted online, and it continues to operate as a micronation offering citizenship and titles through its website.
