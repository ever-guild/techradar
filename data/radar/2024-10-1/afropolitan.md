**Afropolitan** is a growing digital community with plans to develop into a network of decentralized cities that span the globe, with a focus on the African diaspora. The idea is to create a physical and digital space where people can participate in governance and economics through blockchain-based systems, enabling more autonomy and connection within the community.
