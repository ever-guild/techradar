**The Venus Project** envisions a future society where technology and sustainability are at the core of human development. It promotes the concept of a resource-based economy and seeks to create a global society free from the constraints of politics and money. Though still largely conceptual, the community is thematically focused on technological solutions to global problems and sustainable living.
